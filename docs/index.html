The codebase is simple, clean, and intuitive, and is intended to be used as a learning tool. The original idea is based off Little Workshop&apos;s demo game - BrowserQuest.

<h2 id="features">Features</h2><p>Features include what you&apos;d expect from an MMORPG.</p>
<ul>
<li>Multiplayer</li>
<li>Enhanced rendering engine (includes dynamic lighting, overlays, animated tiles)</li>
<li>Region system (client receives only necessary data and saves it)</li>
<li>Questing and achievements system.</li>
<li>Plugin-based combat system (for bosses/special enemies)</li>
<li>And much more</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="region-manager">Region Manager</h3><p>The region system sends data to the client according to the map data of the server. The collisions are checked both server-side and client-side in order to avoid cheating. The region-system has also been updated such that users can create instanced versions of the same area. These areas can be used to draw &apos;alternate&apos; versions of the map, and be used for special events such as minigames. Multiple players can also be added to these regions.</p>
<h3 id="tilesheet-parsing">Tilesheet Parsing</h3><p>The rendering engine has been updated such that it is able to handle multiple tilesheets the same way Tiled editor can. Simply drop in your tilesheet in the <code>client/img/tilesets</code>.</p>
<h2 id="installing-and-running">Installing and Running</h2><p>You must install MongoDB and create a user and a database.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-sh"><code class="source-code prettyprint">npm install
npm start</code>
</code></pre>
<p>Prior to starting Kaetram, make sure you rename the <code>config.json-dist</code> to <code>config.json</code> and modify them accordingly. There are two configurations in <code>server/</code> and <code>client/data</code>.</p>
<h2 id="map-parsing">Map Parsing</h2><p>Once you finish modifying your map in <code>tools/maps/data</code> you can parse the map data by executing <code>exportmap.js</code> in <code>tools/maps</code> directory. Example command:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-sh"><code class="source-code prettyprint">./exportmap.js ./data/map.json</code>
</code></pre>
<h2 id="todo">TODO</h2><ul>
<li>Write documentation outlining the entirety of the source code.</li>
<li><p>Come up with a storyline.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Add (continue) to NPC talking -- spacebar when talking</p>
</li>
</ul>
