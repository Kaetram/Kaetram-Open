         * We use four modifiers to output the final damage, and a weighted randomInt
         * distribution (think graphs skewed to the right or left depending on the accuracy).
         * The maximum damage takes in consideration tha player's strength level, their
         * weapon bonuses, (or their magic/archery if that's what they're using).
         *
         * The accuracy works backwards, 0.45 being the most accurate, and any number heigher
         * skews the graph towards the lower-end (higher likelihood of hitting lower damage).
         *
         * The accuracy consists of four parts, the accuracy bonus, the accuracy level,
         * the defense level of the target, and the accuracy modifier.
         *
         * The accuracy bonus is the bonus given by the attacker's equipment. We picked a maximum
         * of 55 since that is currently the maximum acquirable bonus from equipments the best
         * equipments. It's a linear scaling from 0-1, with highest bonus giving us the highest
         * accuracy. Note that this is subject to changes in the nearby future, and we do not
         * intend to keep it entirely linear.
         *
         * The next is the linear scaling of the accuracy level against the maximum level. The
         * higher your accuracy level, the higher the accuracy. This modifier has an absolute lowest
         * value of 0.01 (most accurate at maximum level) and highest value of 1.35
         * (lowest accuracy at level 1 accuracy).
         *
         * The next is a linear scale of the target's defense level. The higher their defense level the
         * more it will affect our accuracy. The way this was calculated was by considering the maximum
         * level a player will be able to reach (135). If we attack a player with maximum defense, our
         * accuracy will be throttled by 1.015. If we attack a player with level 1 defense, our accuracy
         * will be affected by 0.0075 (giving us more accuracy).
         *
         * Lastly this is the accuracy modifier of the attack stats. The attack stats are compared against
         * the target's defense stats and take into considering the primary attack style of the attacker
         * versus the primary defense style. For example, if we use slash against a target with a high defense
         * in slash, then our accuracy is lower than if we use slash against a target with a low defense in slash.
         * In order to minimize the accuracy of an attacker, your defense style must be the attacker's attack style.
         * If our attack stats are negative due to the target's extremely high defense stats, we append a 1.5
         * reduction in accuracy by default.
         *
         * All of these modifiers added together determine how much we stray away from the highest accuracy - 0.45.
