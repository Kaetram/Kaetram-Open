 * to synchronize amongst servers, and as that was proven inefficient and torturous to
 * maintain, uWebSockets turned out to be far more efficient and less of a headache.
 * The client uses the `incoming` global controller to handle incoming messages from
 * the hub. Note that the player object has its own `incoming` controller and that
