You must deliver some stuff and whatnot. Actually why don't you go talk to him instead of reading this description and spoiling the surprise. By surprise I mean you have to run around the place doing stupid stuff, but whatever, who cares, that's why you signed up on this game didn't you. Or was it because you wanted to grind but your addiction to being a completionist leads you to complete these useless quests. Oh well, this description is long enough.",
