The `map_template.json` provided gives the bare minimum required to start creating a map. Note that you will have to create a `tilesets` folder, copy the tilesets from the client, and re-define the spawn position in the game Modules. We no longer provide the entire map file due to people blatantly copying Kaetram without any form of creative input. This project was created to help those who want to get into game development, not to be copied for monetary gains.

There will be little to no support in map creation from the developers due to time constraints. However, we encourage you to create tutorials and help others if you wish.

Please refer to the following wiki article that outlines how all the objects on the map work. This includes tile properties:
